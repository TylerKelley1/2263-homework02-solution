#Homework 3
In this homework project the use of testFX, Project Lombok, LOG4j2, Makito, and Jacoco are all implemented. The code forked from grifisaa/2263-homework02-solution is first tested with the use of testFX and JUnit assertion tests. Once all of the tests are created and implemented the source code is then cleaned up a little bit with the use of Lombok. Finally LOG4j2 is then implemented into all of the source code classes and outputs all messages into the terminal.
